# Agent Cheat Sheet (token-minimal)

Default posture: **YOLO** (full permissions). Safety is opt-in.

1) Identify your context (repo-dev vs runtime task).
2) Load the current source of truth from disk (files decide).
3) Inspect current/recent runs/logs to avoid duplicate work.
4) Choose the smallest change that achieves the goal.
5) Act (execute, edit, run commands) without ceremony.
6) Validate with concrete evidence (tests/logs/artifacts).
7) Persist outcomes to disk (diffs, outputs, notes).
8) Exit with a crisp summary and pointers to evidence.
